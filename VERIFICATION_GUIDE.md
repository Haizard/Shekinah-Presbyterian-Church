# Verification Guide - All Hardcoded Content Removed

## Quick Verification Steps

### Step 1: Initialize Database
```bash
node initAdmin.js
```

Expected output:
```
✅ Connected to MongoDB
✅ Admin user created successfully
✅ Default church settings created successfully
✅ Default ministry sections created successfully
```

### Step 2: Start Application
```bash
npm start
# In another terminal
cd jsmart1-react && npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Verify Each Page

#### ✅ Home Page - "How We Serve" Section
**Location**: Home page, scroll down to "How We Serve" section

**What to look for**:
- [ ] Section title: "How We Serve"
- [ ] Four service cards with generic titles:
  - "Service Area 1" (not "Community Outreach")
  - "Service Area 2" (not "Youth Ministry")
  - "Service Area 3" (not "Worship Services")
  - "Service Area 4" (not "Bible Study")
- [ ] Generic descriptions like "Describe your first area of ministry and service."
- [ ] No mention of "Shekinah" or "Tanzania"

**If you see hardcoded content**:
1. Hard refresh browser: `Ctrl+Shift+R`
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify database was initialized: `node initAdmin.js`

#### ✅ Ministries Page - Intro Text
**Location**: Ministries page, top section

**What to look for**:
- [ ] Intro text starts with: "We believe that every believer is called to serve."
- [ ] NOT: "At Shekinah Presbyterian Church Tanzania, we believe..."
- [ ] Text is generic and works for any church
- [ ] No church-specific references

**Intro text should be**:
```
"We believe that every believer is called to serve. Our ministries provide opportunities 
for you to use your gifts, grow in your faith, and make a difference in the lives of others."
```

#### ✅ About Page - "Our Motto" Section
**Location**: About page, scroll down to "Our Motto" section

**What to look for**:
- [ ] Motto text: "Enter your church motto here" (or custom motto if edited)
- [ ] NOT: "The True Word, The True Gospel, and True Freedom"
- [ ] Explanation text is generic
- [ ] No Shekinah-specific content

**Default placeholder should show**:
```
"Enter your church motto here"

This motto shapes everything we do in our church and ministry.
Edit this section through the admin panel to add your church's motto, verse reference, and explanation.
```

### Step 4: Verify Admin Panel Works

1. **Log in to Admin Panel**
   - URL: `http://localhost:3000/admin`
   - Email: `admin@shekinah.org`
   - Password: `admin123`

2. **Check Content Manager**
   - Go to: Content Management → Content
   - Look for sections: "how_we_serve", "motto"
   - Verify content is generic placeholder text

3. **Edit Content**
   - Click on "how_we_serve" section
   - Edit one service area title
   - Save changes
   - Go to Home page and verify change appears

---

## Search for Remaining Hardcoded Content

### Search in Browser Console
Open browser console (F12) and search for these terms:

```javascript
// Search for Shekinah references
document.body.innerText.includes('Shekinah')

// Search for Tanzania references
document.body.innerText.includes('Tanzania')

// Search for hardcoded motto
document.body.innerText.includes('The True Word')
```

**Expected Result**: All should return `false`

### Search in Code
Use your IDE's search function to find:

1. **Search for "Shekinah"**
   - Should only appear in:
     - Comments
     - Image paths: `/images/SPCT/`
     - Old initialization scripts (not used)
   - Should NOT appear in:
     - Component render logic
     - Fallback content
     - Default values

2. **Search for "Tanzania"**
   - Should NOT appear anywhere in active code

3. **Search for "The True Word"**
   - Should NOT appear in:
     - OurMottoRenderer.jsx
     - contentMigration.js
   - Should only appear in comments or old files
