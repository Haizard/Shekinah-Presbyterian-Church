# Critical Issues Fixed - Universal Church Project

## Summary
All three critical issues preventing this from being a truly universal church project have been successfully fixed. The website is now completely church-neutral with no hardcoded Shekinah-specific content, images, or data.

---

## ‚úÖ Issue 1: Hardcoded Default Images - FIXED

### Problem
All images throughout the website were set to a default image path `/images/SPCT/CHURCH.jpg`, which shows the Shekinah Presbyterian Church building. This was inappropriate for a universal church project.

### Root Causes Found
1. **Backend initialization scripts** - Default image paths in:
   - `init-content.js`
   - `add-all-missing-content.js`
   - `init-local-db.js`
   - `setup.js`

2. **Frontend utility functions** - Default fallback images in:
   - `jsmart1-react/src/utils/imageUtils.js`
   - `jsmart1-react/src/utils/contentUtils.js`

3. **Frontend components** - Hardcoded fallback images in:
   - `jsmart1-react/src/pages/Home.jsx`
   - `jsmart1-react/src/pages/Gallery.jsx`
   - `jsmart1-react/src/components/admin/ImageVerifier.jsx`

### Solutions Applied
‚úÖ **All image paths replaced with empty string (`''`)**
- Backend: All initialization scripts now use empty string for default images
- Frontend: `imageUtils.js` now defaults to empty string instead of Shekinah image
- Components: Removed hardcoded fallback images
- Fallback content: Updated `createDefaultContent()` in `contentUtils.js` to use empty strings

### Files Modified
- `init-content.js` - Lines 34-147
- `add-all-missing-content.js` - Lines 30-193
- `init-local-db.js` - Lines 20-126
- `setup.js` - Lines 78-97
- `jsmart1-react/src/utils/imageUtils.js` - Lines 31, 76
- `jsmart1-react/src/pages/Home.jsx` - Lines 104-116
- `jsmart1-react/src/pages/Gallery.jsx` - Lines 33-34
- `jsmart1-react/src/utils/contentUtils.js` - Lines 165, 171, 255
- `jsmart1-react/src/components/admin/ImageVerifier.jsx` - Lines 171-178

## ‚úÖ Issue 2: Old Shekinah Data Flashing Before Current Data - FIXED

### Problem
When the website loaded, it briefly displayed old Shekinah Presbyterian Church data, then switched to the current database data. Sometimes the old data persisted until the page was manually refreshed.

### Root Cause
The `DynamicContent` component was creating default content with hardcoded fallback values when data wasn't immediately available. This caused the component to render placeholder content before the actual database data loaded.

### Solution Applied
‚úÖ **Removed default content creation logic**
- Changed `DynamicContent.jsx` to return an empty div instead of creating default content
- Removed fallback content from `About.jsx` component
- Removed fallback content from `DynamicContent` render method

### Files Modified
- `jsmart1-react/src/components/DynamicContent.jsx` - Lines 285-294, 333-338
- `jsmart1-react/src/pages/About.jsx` - Lines 70-76

## ‚úÖ Issue 3: Database Data Not Displaying Until Page Refresh - FIXED

### Problem
Some sections displayed default/placeholder data on initial page load and only showed the actual database-saved data after manually refreshing the page.

### Root Causes
1. **Timing issue** - Components were trying to fetch data before the ContentContext finished its initial load
2. **Hardcoded fallback content** - Default content in `createDefaultContent()` function still had Shekinah-specific images
3. **Missing loading state coordination** - DynamicContent wasn't waiting for ContentContext to finish loading

### Solutions Applied
‚úÖ **Improved data loading coordination**
- Added `loading` state check to `DynamicContent` component
- Components now wait for ContentContext to finish initial loading before fetching
- Added logging to track when initial fetch starts

‚úÖ **Removed all hardcoded Shekinah images from fallback content**
- Updated `createDefaultContent()` in `contentUtils.js` to use empty strings
- Fixed leadership section default images
- Fixed how_we_serve section default image

### Files Modified
- `jsmart1-react/src/context/ContentContext.jsx` - Lines 22-30
- `jsmart1-react/src/components/DynamicContent.jsx` - Lines 71-149, 151-184
- `jsmart1-react/src/utils/contentUtils.js` - Lines 157-184, 251-256
