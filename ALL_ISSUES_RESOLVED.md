# ✅ All Hardcoded Content Issues - RESOLVED

## Summary

All three hardcoded church-specific content issues have been identified, investigated, and fixed. The website is now fully dynamic and universal for any church.

---

## Issue 1: "How We Serve" Section ✅ FIXED

### Problem
The "How We Serve" section displayed hardcoded static content specific to Shekinah Presbyterian Church:
- Community Outreach
- Youth Ministry
- Worship Services
- Bible Study

### Root Cause
Hardcoded content in three files:
1. `init-content.js` - Default initialization
2. `add-all-missing-content.js` - Content migration script
3. `jsmart1-react/src/utils/contentUtils.js` - Fallback content

### Solution
Replaced with generic placeholder content:
- Service Area 1, 2, 3, 4
- Generic descriptions: "Describe your [X] area of ministry and service."

### Files Modified
- ✅ `init-content.js`
- ✅ `add-all-missing-content.js`
- ✅ `jsmart1-react/src/utils/contentUtils.js`

### How to Customize
1. Go to Admin Panel → Content Management → Content
2. Find section: "how_we_serve"
3. Edit service areas with your church's specific ministries
4. Save changes

## Issue 2: Ministries Page Intro Text ✅ FIXED

### Problem
The Ministries page intro contained hardcoded text specific to "Shekinah Presbyterian Church Tanzania":
```
"At Shekinah Presbyterian Church Tanzania, we believe that every believer is called to serve..."
```

### Root Cause
Hardcoded text in `jsmart1-react/src/pages/Ministries.jsx` (2 locations):
1. Fallback text in DynamicContent component
2. Static intro text in "Our Ministries" section

### Solution
Replaced with generic, church-neutral text:
```
"We believe that every believer is called to serve. Our ministries provide opportunities 
for you to use your gifts, grow in your faith, and make a difference in the lives of others."
```

### Files Modified
- ✅ `jsmart1-react/src/pages/Ministries.jsx` (2 locations)

### How to Customize
- Text is now generic and works for any church
- Can be customized through Content Manager if needed

---

## Issue 3: About Page "Our Motto" Section ✅ FIXED

### Problem
The "Our Motto" section displayed hardcoded Shekinah-specific content:
```
"The True Word, The True Gospel, and True Freedom"
Matthew 9:35
[Detailed explanation specific to Shekinah]
```

### Root Cause
Hardcoded default content in two files:
1. `jsmart1-react/src/components/structured/OurMottoRenderer.jsx` - Default motto data
2. `jsmart1-react/src/utils/contentMigration.js` - Migration function

### Solution
Replaced with generic placeholder content:
```
"Enter your church motto here"
[Generic explanation with instructions to customize]
```

### Files Modified
- ✅ `jsmart1-react/src/components/structured/OurMottoRenderer.jsx`
- ✅ `jsmart1-react/src/utils/contentMigration.js`

### How to Customize
1. Go to Admin Panel → Content Management → Content
2. Find section: "motto"
3. Edit with your church's motto, verse reference, and explanation
4. Save changes
